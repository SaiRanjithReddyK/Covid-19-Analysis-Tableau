# COVID-19 Analysis Using Tableau

## Overview
This project uses Tableau to analyze the impact of COVID-19 across different regions, focusing on testing, vaccination, and travel patterns. The goal is to uncover key insights and provide actionable recommendations for policymakers and stakeholders.

## Project Goals
- Understand trends in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and mortality rates.
- Analyze travel patterns during the pandemic.
- Identify correlations between vaccination rates and case reductions.
- Provide visualizations that facilitate data-driven decision-making.

## Dataset Information
The project uses multiple datasets, including:
1. **Air Traffic Passenger Statistics**:
   - Covers passenger traffic trends during the pandemic.
2. **COVID Hospitalizations (LA County)**:
   - Data on hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and recoveries.
3. **US States COVID-19 Cases**:
   - Case trends across all states.
4. **Demographic Data**:
   - Fertility rates, life expectancy, and population statistics


## Key Insights
- **Mortality Analysis**: Higher mortality rates among elderly populations (75+ years).
- **Travel Disruptions**: Significant drop in air travel in 2020, with a gradual recovery in 2022.
- **Vaccination Impact**: Positive correlation between increased vaccination rates and reduced case numbers.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Data Visualization**: Tableau
- **Data Cleaning**: Excel, Python (optional)
- **Reporting**: PDF summaries for stakeholders
